##### I made this project following the begginer tutorial learning called "React JS Website with Tailwind CSS", by the youtube channel Code Commerce.

##### More details:

### I learned how to create and structure a project with react + tailwind & style each component with tailwindCSS.

### & also learned how to implement Smooth Scrolling w. React:

    https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll

### Also, I added a new extension to debug css in my browser. It's called Pesticide, very useful indeed.
